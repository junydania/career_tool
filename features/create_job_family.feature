  Scenario:
    Given I visit the "sign_in" landing page
    And I fill in field "user_email" with "o.dania@icloud.com"
    And I fill in field "user_password" with "12345678"
    And I click on "Log In"
    And I click on "Job Family"
    And I click on "Create Job Family"
    And I click on "Save"
    Then I should see "Job Family Successfully Created"
